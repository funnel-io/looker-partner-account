### What does this Block do for me?
[Funnel](https://funnel.io) takes messy, siloed data from all marketing platforms and automatically generates Business-Ready Data that is fully harmonized, up-to-date and always ready to act upon. Funnel doesnâ€™t require any coding or manual maintenance, which gives you point-and-click control to continuously experiment with new data sources, business logic and tactics without ever breaking the data model.

The Funnel service provides:
- Hundreds of existing marketing sources, and custom sources as part of your enterprise subscription
- Default normalization and mapping of columns like campaign, cost, impressions, clicks
- Initial clean-up and custom grouping to prepare the data for you Looker views
- Funnel compensates for ad platforms that are eventually consistent, with historic data changing for multiple reasons
- Integrations adjust for quotas, rate limits, retries, temporary errors
- Allow your marketing department to manage addition of new ad accounts as well as token and password changes
